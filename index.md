## Course Description

Generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) including ChatGPT have ushered the world into a new era with rich new capabilities for wide-ranging application domains. At the same time, there is little understanding of how these new capabilities emerge, their limitations and potential risks. In this class, we will introduce foundations of LLMs, study methods for better understanding LLMs, discuss scaling laws and emergence, and explore the risks and challenges with these technologies and how we can build towards safe and beneficial AI. In particular, this class will cover a wide-ranging topics including:
- Foundations of LLMs
- Interpretability
- Scaling laws
- Adversarial robustness
- AI alignment and governance
- Trojans and unlearning
- Privacy and watermarking
- Agency and emergence
- Reasoning and mathematics
- Evaluation and benchmarking

## Enrollment and Grading

- ***Prerequisite:*** **Prospective students should have taken CS 182/282A Deep Neural Networks or its equivalent(s) and had at least some hands-on experience with deep learning.**

Prospective students should first try enrolling in the course through CalCentral. The class number of CS 194-267 (for undergraduate students) is 34188 and the class number of CS 294-267 (for graduate students) is 34187. Please join the waitlist if the course is full. Please fill in the [enrollment petition form](https://forms.gle/g9SJYTzCY14HVcsc9) if you can neither enroll in the course nor join the waitlist. We will reach out to you if your petition is approved.

This is a variable-unit course.
All enrolled students are expected to attend lectures in person and submit reading summaries and questions for Q&A before each lecture.
Students enrolling in one unit are expected to write an article that summarizes one of the lectures.
Students enrolling in more than one units are expected to complete a lab assignment and a project.
The project of students enrolling in 2 units should have a written report, which can be a survey in an area relevant to LLMs.
The project of students enrolling in 3 units should also have an implementation (coding) component that programmatically interacts with LLMs, and the project of students enrolling in 4 units should have a significant implementation component with the potential for either real world impacts or intellectual contributions.
The grade breakdowns for students enrolled in different units are the following:

|                                       | 1 unit | 2 units | 3/4 units |
|---------------------------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Lecture participation                 | 25%    | 10%     | 5%        |
| Reading summaries & questions for Q&A | 25%    | 10%     | 5%        |
| Article                               | 50%    |         |           |
| Lab                                   |        | 20%     | 10%       |
| Project                               |        |         |           |
| - *Proposal*                          |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| - *Milestone*                         |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| - *Presentation*                      |        | 25%     | 25%       |
