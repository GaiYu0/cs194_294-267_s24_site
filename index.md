## Enrollment and Grading

Prospective undergraduate students should have taken CS 182 Deep Neural Networks or equivalent and had at least 3 months of hands-on experience with deep learning.
Undergraduate students should enroll in CS 194-267.
Graduate students should enroll in CS 294-267. 

This is a variable-unit course.
All enrolled students are expected to participate in lectures in person.
Students enrolling in one unit are expected to write an article that summarizes one of the lectures.
Students enrolling in more than one units are expected to complete a lab assignment and a project.
The project of students enrolling in 2 units should have a written report, which can be a survey in an area relevant to LLMs.
The project of students enrolling in 3 units should also have an implementation (coding) component that programmatically interacts with LLMs, and the project of students enrolling in 4 units should have a significant implementation component with the potential for either real world impacts or intellectual contributions.
The grade breakdowns for students enrolled in different units are the following:

|                    | 1 unit | 2 units | 3/4 units |
|--------------------|--------|---------|-----------|
| Participation      | 50%    | 20%     | 10%       |
| Article            | 50%    |         |           |
| Lab                |        | 20%     | 10%       |
| Project            |        |         |           |
| - *Proposal*       |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| - *Milestone*      |        | 10%     | 10%       |
| - *Presentation*   |        | 25%     | 25%       |
| - *Report*         |        | 15%     | 15%       |
| - *Implementation* |        |         | 20%       |
